I am signing up for Replit`s 100 days of Python challenge! I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day. I`ll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happen to be.No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field! "

I am feeling  happy.
